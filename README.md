# Flask Todo App with User Management and Accessibility Focus

Description:
This is a user-friendly todo app built with Flask, Bootstrap, and Menten for task management. It prioritizes accessibility for users with visual impairments and utilizes Flask-Login, bcrypt, and Flask-Migrate for robust authentication, password hashing, and database migrations.

Key Features:
• User authentication and authorization
• Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing
• Database migration management with Flask-Migrate
• Ability to add, edit, and delete tasks
• Send password reset emails
• Accessible design principles (although further UI/UX refinement might be necessary)
Note:
Due to the developer's reliance on screen readers for development, the front-end functionality might require additional enhancements.

Technologies Used:
• Backend:
• Flask: Python microframework for web applications
• Flask-Login: User authentication and management
• bcrypt: Secure password hashing
• Flask-Migrate: Database migration management
• Frontend:
• Bootstrap: Responsive design framework (potentially needs further optimization)
